1 x y your and are very so is going to be smaller way too small to influence the results of your so as far as 1 x means you can store the numbers with 1 and instead of just add them as long as the results are always much less than be close enough to the mathematically precise results that you care about the just you say of them are very close to obviously this technique work for numbers that are not close to 1 that if and are but if one is large and one is it might still you only care about the magnitude of the product if both numbers are not close to you can just use regular java

2 other answers have the dpi settings may be giving you i have found that mixing with px sizing can be a real challenge once you consider dpi settings and different browser default now i just use px for font most of the problems go force that single user back to the regular i willing to bet that they are need reading glasses and the new high res monitor they got was harder to read because the print was so someone adjusted the dpi and now the fonts are the same size as the old so now they really do like the new monitor the problem now is some web pages are messed where you come thing you might want to look at when changing monitors from a crt to flat screen is the digital font smoothing fuzzy characters become this does not affect your web to address point raised by makes some excellent points in his context certainly answer was a bit lazy and the reason i use px is because of the inconsistency across to my way of specifying a point size should specify the physical size of the character to the user on the device he is but in practice it does suppose you most browsers under this defaults to the much maligned ie7 decided to use some other default and that font seems smaller and less readable in the same point the same can be said of arial verdana specify the same point and your whole layout throw in dpi settings on setup and it is setting is a bit of an your monitor or phone has a fixed you can only change it if you get a new monitor or having a dialog box to change the dpi is there only because the device does not report to the operating system what the dpi an imperfect i leave you with this suggestion use px for now to specify the font but only use it make all other sizes relative to your base when you have to port everything over to the latest blackberry or ipod that does a better job of switching from 11px to 11pt will be and test out your software so it does look nice as you boost the font	
200 that probably it should be a 30x status rather than 200 see is best for the response to a and should be a complete absolute your script just says without the 30x cgi servers will usually do an internal redirect by fetching the new url and returning it without telling the browser anything funny this may sound like what you want but it really because from the point of view no different from the original script returning a 200 and direct that would cause a the browser will request url practice probably not as bad as you thanks to the client should be able to respond to the redirect straight away the next as long as on the same there any way that will tell the browser to request when i hit f5 instead of post submission stick with the model for solving
